# Task-Tracker

Task-Tracker is a command-line interface (CLI) application that helps you track and manage your tasks. This project is designed to help you practice your programming skills by building a simple yet functional CLI app to handle to-do tasks, track progress, and manage completed work.

## Requirements

The application should:
- Run from the command line.
- Accept user actions and inputs as arguments.
- Store tasks in a JSON file in the current directory. Create the file if it doesnâ€™t exist.
- Allow the user to:
  - Add, update, and delete tasks.
  - Mark a task as in progress or done.
  - List all tasks, tasks that are done, tasks that are not done, and tasks that are in progress.

### Constraints
- You can use any programming language.
- Use positional arguments in the command line to accept user inputs.
- Use the native file system module of your programming language to interact with the JSON file.
- Do not use any external libraries or frameworks.
- Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.
